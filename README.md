Vehicles play a vital role in modern-day intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Plate characters provide a standard means of identification for any vehicle. To serve this purpose, an automatic license plate recognition system is studied. In this paper, we intend to create an optimized algorithm for implementing the scheme. Firstly, we undertake several challenging stages. The first step is introduced as the determination of plate location. Then, in the second phase, we apply an initial improvement to decline the likely noises using the Gaussian function to provide an appropriate filter for this target. Next, the rest of the project is organized as follows, finding the edge of images, enhancing modified pictures, and selecting the exact place of the plate. Afterward, tilting and plate rotation improvement and plate characters' extraction are considered two essential steps in this regard. Eventually, the final step of this project consists of several stages, such as employing a neural network to extract the plate characters automatically.
